// hopefully optimized Erastothenes sieve
//structure: take input of limit
//start incremental loop
//every prime is added to a key,value list
//key is the prime 
//value is countdown before next multiple
//each loop check if any countdown is True
//if all empty, add to list of primes and key/value
